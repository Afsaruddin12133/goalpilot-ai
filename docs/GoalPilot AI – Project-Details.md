## Project Overview

GoalPilot AI is an intelligent goal planning platform that helps users transform there goals into clear, actionable daily tasks. Unlike traditional to-do or planning apps, GoalPilot AI first understands the user’s context through an AI-driven interview, then generates a structured execution plan backed by milestones, timelines, and priorities. The project demonstrates modern full-stack development, clean system design, and practical AI engineering.

## Problem Statement

Every people have goals, ambitions, and dreams, but they struggle to convert them into clear, actionable daily task.
Existing productivity tools focus on task tracking, not goal understanding, context awareness, or intelligent planning.
As a result, users keep goals in their minds, feel overwhelmed, lose direction, and fail to make consistent progress.

There is no simple system that:

- understands a user’s goal deeply
- asks clarifying questions
- generates a realistic, time-boxed action plan
- and continuously connects daily tasks to long-term goals

## Core Features

### 1. AI Goal Interview

**Purpose:** To understand real context before generating any plan, showing AI reasoning rather than simple text generation.

Users start by entering a high-level goal.
The AI then conducts a smart interview (5–8 questions) covering:

- Deadline
- Current skill or progress level
- Available time per day/week
- Constraints and limitations
- Motivation and priority

### 2. AI-Generated Action Plan

**Purpose:** To generate a realistic, time-boxed action plan that is backed by milestones, timelines, and priorities.

**The AI converts:** Goal → Milestones → Weekly Plan → Daily Tasks

Each task includes:

- Priority level
- Estimated time
- Linked milestone
- Linked goal
- Due date
- Status (In Progress/Completed)

### 3. Daily Focus View

**Purpose:** To reduce cognitive overload and improve execution.

Psychology-driven interface showing:

- Top 3 tasks for today
- Progress bar toward the main goal
- Why this task matters (1 AI-generated line)

### 4. Progress & Goal Visibility

**Purpose:** To get clear visibility of progress and goals.

Users can clearly see:

- Overall completion percentage
- Completed vs remaining milestones
- Time remaining compared to the current pace

### 5. Export & Share

**Purpose:** To keep users motivated toward their goals by sharing with friends and family.

Users can:

- Export plans as JSON or CSV
- Generate Notion-ready formats
- Share a read-only public goal link
